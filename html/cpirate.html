<h2><a name="description"></a>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>'pirate' performs statistical phase improvement by classifying the
electron density map by sparseness/denseness and order/disorder, with
the aim of obtaining superior results to conventional solvent mask
based methods without requiring knowledge of the solvent content.</p>

<p>The target distributions are generated by a simulation calculation
using a known 'reference' structure for which calculated phases are
available. The success of the method is dependent on the features of
the reference structure matching those of the unsolved, 'work'
structure. For the common case of a protein of mostly equal atoms
(i.e. not a metalloprotein), a standard set of reference structures
can be tested, and the one with the best Free residuals used for a
full phasing calculation.</p>

<h2><a name="howtorun"></a>HOW TO RUN PIRATE</h2>

<p>To get the best results from 'pirate', you must run it several
times to select the best reference structure. These initial runs are
for a single cycle only, and the output is ignored. Simply check the
Free-E correlation in the log file to determine which reference
structure gives the best results.</p>

<p>A set of reference structure should have been provided by whoever
installed 'pirate' on your system. These are suitable for common
light-atom protein structures with varying solvent content and
resolution up to 2.0A. For exotic cases and high resolution cases you
will have to provide your own reference structures.</p>

<p>Once you have identified the best reference structure, make a
longer run (3-5 cycles) to produce an improved set of phases.</p>

<p>You may have to adjust the log-likelihood weights in some
cases. The Free-E correlation is less helpful for this purpose - look
at the maps to decide if this is necessary.</p>

<h2><a name="files"></a>INPUT/OUTPUT FILES</h2>

<dl>
<dt>-mtzin-ref</dt> <dd>Input 'reference' MTZ file. This contains the
data for a known, reference structure. The required columns are F,
sigF, and a set of Hendrickson-Lattman (HL) coefficients describing
the calculated phases from the final model. Suitable reference
structures can be constructed from the PDB using the
makereference.csh script.</dd>

<dt>-mtzin-wrk</dt> <dd>Input 'work' MTZ file. This contains the data
for the unknown, work structure. The required columns are F, sigF, and
a set of HL coefficients from a phasing program (experimental or
molecular replacement). A Free-R flag may be provided. The HL
distributions should be accurate - in my experience no current program
fulfils this criterion, although Solve comes close. I have strong
hopes for Phaser. Currently, the input HL coefficients are corrected
using a user parameter.</dd>

<dt>-mtzout</dt> <dd>Output MTZ file. This will contain the updated HL
coefficients, and map coefficients for a best electron density map,
including restored values for missing reflections.</dd>

<h2><a name="keywords"></a>KEYWORDED INPUT</h2>

See <a href="#notekeywords">Note on keyword input</a>.
<blockquote>
<h3><a name="colin-ref-fo"></a>-colin-ref-fo <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>Observed F and sigma for reference structure. See <a
href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="colin-ref-hl"></a>-colin-ref-hl <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients for reference structure. If you do
not have these, they can be generated using the accompanying chltofom
program. See <a href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="colin-wrk-fo"></a>-colin-wrk-fo <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>Observed F and sigma for work structure. See <a
href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="colin-wrk-hl"></a>-colin-wrk-hl <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients for work structure. See <a
href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="colin-wrk-free"></a>-colin-wrk-free <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Free-R flag for work structure. See <a
href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="colout"></a>-colout <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Column group name for all output columns.</p>

<h3><a name="colout-hl"></a>-colout-hl <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Column group name for HL column group only.</p>

<h3><a name="colout-fc"></a>-colout-fc <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Column group name for map coefficient group only.</p>

<h3><a name="ncycles"></a>-ncycles <i>cycles</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Number of cycles to perform. Default is 1 cycle, to
produce a rigorous set of phase probability distributions and
statistics. For a best map, run 3-5 cycles.</p>

<h3><a name="weight-expllk"></a>-weight-expllk <i>weight</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Weight to apply to input HL coefficients. This is to
correct for deficiencies in phasing programs. With next-generation
phasing software, this parameter will be fixed at 1.0. Until then, try
0.5, and then 1.0 and 2.0 if results are poor.</p>

<h3><a name="weight-mapllk"></a>-weight-mapllk <i>weight</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Weight to apply to map likelihood. Default is 0.1. You
may be able to optimise this using the Free-E correl. Find the weight
which gives the best Free-E correl, and then divide it by 2 for your
final run.</p>

<h3><a name="weight-ramp"></a>-weight-ramp <i>weight</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Weight for the ramping up of the map likelihood. Defaults
are 2.0 in normal mode and 1.0 in unbias mode.</p>

<h3><a name="unbias"></a>-unbias</h3>

<p>[Optional] Select '-unbias' to remove bias from molecular
replacement models. This is a more sophisticated version of the 'dm'
COMBINE WEIGHT option.</p>

<h3><a name="evaluate"></a>-evaluate</h3>

<p>[Optional] Select '-evaluate' to run a quick evaluation calculation
to test a reference structure.</p>

<h3><a name="strict-free"></a>-strict-free</h3>

<p>[Optional] Select '-strict-free' to keep the free-set for every
cycle of a multi-cycle calculation. This may lead to a worse map, but
may be a good idea if you want to try and refine against the final
output phases. A better option is to run only one cycle to produce
phases for refinement, or more to make a map.</p>

<h3><a name="stats-radius"></a>-stats-radius <i>radius/A</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Radius for local mean and standard deviation, used in
classifying the map. Default 9.0A. Current experience suggests there
is not much to be gained by varying this value.</p>

<h3><a name="seed"></a>-seed <i>seed</i></h3>
<h3><a name="verbose"></a>-verbose <i>verbosity</i></h3>

<h4><a name="notecolpaths"></a>Note on column paths:</h4> <p>When
using the command line, MTZ columns are described as groups using a
slash separated format including the crystal and dataset name. If your
data was generated by another column-group using program, you can just
specify the name of the group, for example '/native/peak/Fobs'. You
can wildcard the crystal and dataset if the file does not contain any
duplicate labels, e.g. '/*/*/Fobs'. You can also access individual
non-grouped columns from existing files by giving a comma-separated
list of names in square brackets, e.g. '/*/*/[FP,SIGFP]'.</p>

<h4><a name="notekeywords"></a>Note on keyword input:</h4>
<p>Keywords may appear on the command line, or by specifying the
'-stdin' flag, on standard input. In the latter case, one keyword is
given per line and the '-' is optional, and the rest of the line is
the argument of that keyword if required, so quoting is not used in
this case.</p>

<h2>Reading the Ouput:</h2>

<p>The program outputs a short list of statistics each cycle. The
Free-E correlation is probably the most useful (larger is
better). After the first cycle these may be biased in various
ways. They are fairly useful for selecting a reference structure from
a list of candidates or for selecting a radius. They can be used to
control the likelihood weighting, but see the notes under the keyword
for the appropriate protocol.</p>

<h2>Problems:</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the work structure has centric reflections and the reference
structure does not, the program will fail.</li>
</ul>
