<h2><a name="description"></a>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>'sequins' performs sequence validation by comparing the model side
chains against the electron density. It may be run with phases from
experimental phasing, or it can calculate its own phases using a
side-chain-omit process. In this case it can be used after molecular
replacement, or to validate structures in the PDB.</p>


<h2><a name="howtorun"></a>HOW TO RUN SEQUINS</h2>

<p>A set of reference structure will have been provided with the
program. The structure 1TQW is good for typical protein problems at
resolutions up to 1.25A, although in practice including data much
beyond 2.0A doesn't make much difference. For exotic cases you might
want to provide your own reference structures.
</p>


<h2><a name="files"></a>INPUT/OUTPUT FILES</h2>

<dl>
<dt>-pdbin-ref</dt> <dd>Input PDB file containing the final model for
the reference structure.</dd>

<dt>-mtzin-ref</dt> <dd>Input 'reference' MTZ file. This contains the
data for a known, reference structure. The required columns are F,
sigF, and a set of Hendrickson-Lattman (HL) coefficients describing
the calculated phases from the final model. Suitable reference
structures can be constructed from the PDB using the 'Make Pirate
reference' task.</dd>

<dt>-mtzin-wrk</dt> <dd>Input 'work' MTZ file. This contains the data
for the unknown, work structure. The required columns are F, sigF, and
optionally a set of HL coefficients from a phasing program or phase
improvement.</dd>

<dt>-pdbin-wrk</dt> <dd>Input PDB file containing an initial
model. </dd>


<h2><a name="keywords"></a>KEYWORDED INPUT</h2>

See <a href="#notekeywords">Note on keyword input</a>.
<blockquote>
<h3><a name="colin-ref-fo"></a>-colin-ref-fo <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>Observed F and sigma for reference structure. See <a
href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="colin-ref-hl"></a>-colin-ref-hl <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients for reference structure. If you do
not have these, they can be generated using the accompanying chltofom
program. See <a href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="colin-wrk-fo"></a>-colin-wrk-fo <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>Observed F and sigma for work structure. See <a
href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="colin-wrk-hl"></a>-colin-wrk-hl <i>colpath</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients for work structure. See <a
href="#notecolpaths">Note on column paths</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="resolution"></a>-resolution <i>resolution/A</i></h3>

<p>[Optional] Resolution limit for the calculation. All data is truncated.</p>

<h3><a name="side-chain-omit"></a>-side-chain-omit</h3>

<p>[Optional] Calculate a side-chain omit map, removing the side
chains from the map calculation, and thus reducing bias to the input
data. For good data this shouldn't matter. For poor data, the phasing
may be too poor without the side chain atoms. If in doubt, try
both.</p>

<h3><a name="correlation-mode"></a>-correlation-mode</h3>

<p>[Optional] Use the correlation target function for growing new
chains and for sequencing. This is less effective for initial
building, but better for model completion, especially after molecular
replacement. If in doubt, try both.</p>

<h3><a name="verbose"></a>-verbose <i>verbosity</i></h3>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="notecolpaths"></a>Note on column paths:</h4> <p>When
using the command line, MTZ columns are described as groups using a
slash separated format including the crystal and dataset name. If your
data was generated by another column-group using program, you can just
specify the name of the group, for example '/native/peak/Fobs'. You
can wildcard the crystal and dataset if the file does not contain any
duplicate labels, e.g. '/*/*/Fobs'. You can also access individual
non-grouped columns from existing files by giving a comma-separated
list of names in square brackets, e.g. '/*/*/[FP,SIGFP]'.</p>

<h4><a name="notekeywords"></a>Note on keyword input:</h4>
<p>Keywords may appear on the command line, or by specifying the
'-stdin' flag, on standard input. In the latter case, one keyword is
given per line and the '-' is optional, and the rest of the line is
the argument of that keyword if required, so quoting is not used in
this case.</p>

<h2>Reading the Output:</h2>

<p>The program outputs a list of protein chains, along with the
original and suggested sequences. For each chain, the original
sequence is printed, along with a modified sequence, modified to give
the best match to the electron density. In the modified sequence,
there may be '?'s for residues which cannot be reliably sequenced, and
'+'s and '-'s to indicate possible insertions and deletions.</p>

<p>It is normal for the endmost residues of a chain to be converted to
'?'s. Loops with poor density sometimes give rise to short register
shifts with low confidence. If you get a longer region (10 residues or
more) bracketed by one or more '+' and '-' symbols, and the confidence
score is greater than 0.95, then there may be a problem.</p>
