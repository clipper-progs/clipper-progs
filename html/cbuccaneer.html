<h2><a name="description"></a>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>'buccaneer' performs statistical chain tracing by identifying
connected alpha-carbon positions using a likelihood-based density
target.</p>

<p>The target distributions are generated by a simulation calculation
using a known 'reference' structure for which calculated phases are
available. The success of the method is dependent on the features of
the reference structure matching those of the unsolved, 'work'
structure. For almost all cases, a single reference structure can be
used, with modifications automatically applied to the reference
structure to match its features to the work structure.</p>

<p>Buccaneer does not do refinement or rebuilding. Until these are
implemented it will not be directly comparable to existing automated
model building packages. However, it is quite quick, and can work at
reasonably low resolutions given good phases.</p>


<h2><a name="howtorun"></a>HOW TO RUN BUCCANEER</h2>

<p>A set of reference structure will have been provided with the
program. The structure 1TQW is good for typical protein problems at
resolutions up to 1.25A, although in practice including data much
beyond 2.0A doesn't make much difference. For exotic cases you might
want to provide your own reference structures.
</p>

<p>The calculation involves 6 main stages:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Finding C-alphas</dt> <dd>Candidate C-alpha positions are located
by searching the electron density. This stage can be disabled by
providing an input PDB for the work structure.</dd>

<dt>Growing fragments</dt> <dd>The candidate C-alphas or input chains
are grown by adding residues at either end, according to the
density. This stage can be disabled by the -no-grow keyword.</dd>

<dt>Joining Fragments</dt> <dd>Overlapping fragments are joined to
make longer chains. If this leads to a junction in a chain, the
contested residue is removed. This stage can be disabled by the
-no-join keyword.</dd>

<dt>Pruning Fragments</dt> <dd>Clashing fragments are examined and the
one with the worse density is removed. This stage can be disabled by
the -no-prune keyword.</dd>

<dt>Assigning Sequence</dt> <dd>Likelihood comparison between the
density of each residue in the work structure and the residues of the
reference structure allows sequence to be assigned to longer
fragments. An optional correction step allows one-residue shifts to be
fixed automatically.

<dt>Rebuilding</dt> <dd>Rebuilding allows side chain atoms and
carbonyl oxygens to be rebuilt.
</dl>

<h2><a name="files"></a>INPUT/OUTPUT FILES</h2>

<dl>
<dt>-pdbin-ref</dt> <dd>Input PDB file containing the final model for
the reference structure.</dd>

<dt>-mtzin-ref</dt> <dd>Input 'reference' MTZ file. This contains the
data for a known, reference structure. The required columns are F,
sigF, and a set of Hendrickson-Lattman (HL) coefficients describing
the calculated phases from the final model. Suitable reference
structures can be constructed from the PDB using the 'Make Pirate
reference' task.</dd>

<dt>-mtzin-wrk</dt> <dd>Input 'work' MTZ file. This contains the data
for the unknown, work structure. The required columns are F, sigF, and
a set of HL coefficients from a phasing program (experimental or
molecular replacement).</dd>

<dt>-pdbin-wrk</dt> <dd>[Optional] Input PDB file containing an
initial model. </dd>

<dt>-pdbout-wrk</dt> <dd>Output PDB file. This will contain the new
chain trace.</dd>
</dl>

secondary structure types, it is possible to preferentially find
different types of sequence. <i>type</i> may be one of <tt>all, helix,

<h3><a name="known-structure"></a>-known-structure <i>known-structure-spec</i></h3>
<dl><dd> A single known-structure group can be specified in the general parameters (above), however for more complex cases multiple groups can be defined using keyword input. The known-structure keyword allows atoms or chains from the input model (given using the 'Specify input model to be extended' button at the top of the window) to be preserved. This can be useful when heavy atoms or nucleotide chains comprise a significant portion of the scattering. 
</dd><dd> Syntax: <tt>known-structure coordinateID:radius</tt>
</dd><dd> Atoms specified by the coordinateID will be retained in the output structure. If a radius is specified, then no main chain atoms will be built within the given radius of the specified atoms. Multiple known-structure keywords may be given with different radii. Examples:
<ul><li> <tt>known-structure /A/*/*/:2.0</tt>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> Keep all atoms in the A chain and don't build within 2A.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li> <tt>known-structure /*/*/ZN&nbsp;&nbsp;/:3.0</tt>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> Keep all Zinc atoms and don't build within 3A.
</dd></dl>
<ul><li> <tt>known-structure //*/*/</tt>
</li></ul>
<dl><dd> Keep all atoms in the unlabelled chain. (REQUIRES REFMAC UPGRADE) 
</dd></dl>

<h4><a name="notecolpaths"></a>Note on column paths:</h4> <p>When
using the command line, MTZ columns are described as groups using a
slash separated format including the crystal and dataset name. If your
data was generated by another column-group using program, you can just
specify the name of the group, for example '/native/peak/Fobs'. You
can wildcard the crystal and dataset if the file does not contain any
duplicate labels, e.g. '/*/*/Fobs'. You can also access individual
non-grouped columns from existing files by giving a comma-separated
list of names in square brackets, e.g. '/*/*/[FP,SIGFP]'.</p>

<h4><a name="notekeywords"></a>Note on keyword input:</h4>
<p>Keywords may appear on the command line, or by specifying the
'-stdin' flag, on standard input. In the latter case, one keyword is
given per line and the '-' is optional, and the rest of the line is
the argument of that keyword if required, so quoting is not used in
this case.</p>

<h2>Reading the Output:</h2>

<p>The program outputs a short list of statistics each cycle. The
Free-E correlation is probably the most useful (larger is
better). After the first cycle these may be biased in various
ways. They are fairly useful for selecting a reference structure from
a list of candidates or for selecting a radius. They can be used to
control the likelihood weighting, but see the notes under the keyword
for the appropriate protocol.</p>
